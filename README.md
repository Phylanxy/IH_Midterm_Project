# IH_Midterm_Project
 
## Project Context
- Initiative: Green Jobs – Green New York Initiative 2009 - 2011
    - Provide New Yorkers with access to free or low-cost energy assessments, energy upgrade services, low-cost financing, and training for various „green-collar‟ careers
- Subinitiative: The Residential Existing Homes Program
    - market transformation program to install comprehensive housing energy-efficient improvements in NY State

## Team
Leo Krohne and Lukas Bauerschmidt

## Type of Project
**Tableau Visualization**

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Shape: 55,000 instances x 29 columns

## Extract of Features
- Geography of Building
- Project Completion Date
- Total Project Cost
- Total Incentives
- Size of Home
- Volume of Home
- Year Home Built
- Estimated Annual kWh Savings
- Instances: 1 Instance = 1 Energy Efficiency Project

## Project Goals
- Check subgoals of Green Jobs – Green New York Initiative
- Investigate if “The Residential Existing Homes Program” subinitiative was successfull
   - Defining the key success metric
- Visualization
    - Geographical Heatmap
        - Which areas of NY State show higher estimated cost efficiencies than other? (Area vs. Estimated Cost Savings)
    - Which energy provider is dominantly leading the NY State market?

    - What is the impact of Pre-Retrofit Fuel Type on the savings?
- Linear Regression
    - Y = Estimated Cost Savings per Project
    - X = Factors that may influence cost savings
